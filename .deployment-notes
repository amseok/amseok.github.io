## Service Worker Requirements for GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages serves static files correctly for PWA deployment. The service worker (sw.js) 
will be served with the correct MIME type and headers automatically.

## Asset Structure
- All chunked assets are in /assets/ directory
- Service worker is at root level (/sw.js)
- Manifest is properly linked in index.html
- All PWA requirements are met for GitHub Pages

## Cache Strategy
- Precache: 22 entries totaling ~6MB
- Runtime cache: Google Fonts and other external resources
- Update strategy: Automatic updates on new deployments

## Performance Metrics Expected
- First Load: ~380KB (compressed)
- Repeat visits: ~0KB (cached)
- Offline: Full functionality available
